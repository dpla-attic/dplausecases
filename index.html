    <h2>Scenario summary: Student Homework Assignment</h2>
        <p>
        14 year old Orion in Geneva, New York has a local history homework assignment that asks him to report on one of the five Iriquois Nations.  
        
        Orion has his own laptop computer.
        </p>
    <h2>Goals</h2>
    Orion's interested in having fun after school on Friday and getting his homework done so it won't interfere with his plans. 
    <h2>Narrative</h2>
    <p>Orion is in a hurry to do his history paper on one of the five tribes of the Iriquois nation.  He's a good student, but history is not his favorite subject and spring has sprung in upstate New York.  It is currently 76 degrees and sunny outside.  All winter Orion has been playing the Tony Hawk video game, dreaming of the day the snow would finally melt so he could get out to Shredder's Skatepark to learn a 180 heelflip.  Friday all his boys will be hitting the ramps and he wants to go along.
</p>
<p>Today is Thursday so Orion rides his board home from school, fixes a snack, sits down on the couch, and breaks out his laptop.  "Stupid report," he mutters as he browses to Wikipedia and finds the article on the Iroquois.  He knows full well his history teacher isn't OK with him doing all of his research on Wikipedia, but Orion pretty much always starts at Google or Wikipedia for his reports, "it's just so easy."
</p>
<p>"Ah, the Mohawks sound pretty cool," says Orion as he scans the Wikipedia page. "Punk rock Indians, awesome."
</p>
<p>What Orion doesn't realize is that his teacher, Ms. Montana, has an ulterior motive in this assignment.  She has required that he do the project on awesomehistoryapp.com.  While it appears to Orion that the assignment is all about selecting a tribe and regurgitating their history in a paper, Ms. Montana actually wants Orion to assemble a collection of quality sources which he will cite or reference in his report.  This project is about teaching research skills, not about the paper!  Knowing that the DPLA is the go-to source for all cultural heritage content on the web, Ms. Montana has a teacher's account on a website called awesomehistoryapp.com that pulls all of its content from the DPLA while adding a social layer as well.  She loves this site because of all of the important primary source material from libraries, museums and archives, but also because students have the opportunity to interact with one another in a loosely structured learning environment.
</p>
<p>Orion points his browser to awesomehistoryapp.com/montana/iriquois to find the details of his assignment.  Ms. Montana set up a project page on awesomehistoryapp.com for all of her students so that they can log on and begin their research.  Orion reads that he has to find at least 5 different sources for his report, 3 of which must have come from the DPLA network.  He'll use Wikipedia for one of the non-DPLA sources (Ms. Montana has a liberal view about the authority of Wikipedia) and a book from his school library for another.  Orion scans the Iroquois project page and sees that while most of the class chose to report on the Algonquin tribe, 6 of the 26 students in his class have already committed to the Mohawks as their tribe of choice, and that 4 of those students have already started building collections of materials.  In fact, Janey Beddathanyew, the sharpest student in the class is done and her collection of sources is complete, has 14 items, and is ready to be browsed!  Score!
</p>
<p>Orion knows that if he simply lifts three sources from Janey's collection of materials Ms. Montana will realize this when she requests a project report from awesomehistoryapp.com. Items in awesomehistoryapp.com get a timestamp and userstamp when they are saved to a collection, and it will be clear Orion looked at Janey's completed collection since she was the first one done.  So Orion sets up his own folder called 'OrionsMohawk', he copies two of Janey's sources to his folder, and he sets out to find a unique source to add to his collection.
</p>
<p>In the search bar, Orion types "Mohawk Indians" and awesomehistoryapp.com returns a list of results.  Once again, logged-in Orion sees all of Janey's diligent work as the list of results displays his class contacts' avatars next to items they've already saved to their collections.  Janey's avatar is all over the place in the results; she clearly is getting deep with this project.  "Hmf," says Orion.  "I can find some stuff that little Janey overlooked, and that should get Ms. Montana off my back and I'll be able to go to Shredder's tomorrow afternoon".  
</p>
<p>So he gets to work.  Orion plays with the location settings, adds filters to his search, and eventually finds another item that none of his classmates have.  He adds the item to his 'OrionsMohawk' collection, changes his collection setting from "in progress" to "completed", and moves into the authoring module of awesomehistoryapp.com to create his own unique paper.  
</p>
<p>A paper in awesomehistoryapp.com has a different relationship to its source material than a typical paper.  Orion's paper lives in the 'OrionsMohawk' directory with all of the resources he collected to cite in it.  Orion writes his paper using all of the convenient built in citation tools offered by awesomehistoryapp.com, exports the folder creating an "offline" version of his paper, and clicks a button to alert Ms. Montana that his paper and citations are now completed and available for her review.
</p>
<p>The next day, Orion has nothing Iriquois related on his mind as he sticks his first 180 heelflip at Shredders Skatepark.  He is stoked.
</p>

    <h2>Scenario summary: Job Seeker</h2>
        <p>
        Adult Becky lives in Lockhart, Texas and she wants to get a job at the local grocery store chain, but Becky has no resume.    
        <br>
        Becky has no computer, and she doesn't know how to use one.
        </p>
    <h2>Goals</h2>
    Becky needs a job.  She'd rather be gardening 4 days a week, but she's going to do what she has to do for her family.
    <h2>Narrative</h2>
   <p> Becky has lived in Lockhart Texas for a few years, but she's gotten around the Southwest quite a bit.  Her husband, Rick, has been in the trade show business his entire life.  Things were always just fine for the two of them on Rick's salary but the economic downturn hit his business hard.  Rick is half as busy as he used to be.  Becky hasn't needed to work in years but in order for her and Rick to make ends meet, they've decided she will have to take a job somewhere in town.  When she was shopping last Tuesday, Becky noticed a sign at the local grocery store:</strong> "Now Hiring!"  Becky's heart lept.  The grocery store is only a 10 minute walk from her house!  What a great opportunity.  Then she read on...
</p>
<p>
"Submit your application and resume at www.texasgrocerystore.com"
</p>
<p>
Becky's heart sank.
</p>
<p>
Becky had never really gotten around to learning her way around a computer and the internet.  Her friends talk about Facebook and all of the fun they have on there, and while she's been tempted she just never got around to it. If you asked her why she'd probably say "I'd rather be in the garden".  Becky sure didn't see this coming.  What to do?  Then she remembered... her local public library has computers... and everyone is so nice over there... maybe they can help?
</p>
<p>
In the Lockhart Public Library Becky steps to the front desk and explains her situation to the librarian, Roxanne.  Roxanne patiently listens and assures Becky it is no problem at all, she can set up a 30 minute appointment on a public computer and a librarian will help get her started.  
</p>
<p>
"I'll warn you", says Roxanne, "There's a lot to learn.  You may not be able to get all of this accomplished today, but I can point you to all of the different things you'll need to learn and practice.  You'll need to make a commitment to this, but it will pay off in the end."
</p>
<p>
"Thank you, this means so much to me!" responds Becky.  The two of them settle down at a public computer station and get to work.
</p>
<p>
Roxanne has assembled a collection of resources about job hunting that she'd love to share with Becky, but she quickly discovers that Becky needs to take the library's Computer Basics class first.  She explains to Becky that in this class she'll learn how to sign up for a free email account that she can use to connect with her friends, family, and other websites which will require her to have an email address to register with them.  
</p>
<p>
"This is essential for submitting job applications," Roxanne explains. 
</p>
<p>
Roxanne built her Computer Basics class, as well as her Facebook 101, How to Write an Effective Resume, and How to Evaluate a Job Seeking Website classes from the DPLA curriculum sharing app.  Roxanne doesn't know what she'd do without this database full of ranked, shared curricula; there would never be time or resources to design all of these classes herself.
</p>
<p>
A year ago, a talented librarian named Jessica from Flint, Michigan had received an IMLS grant to build capacity at her library in the job and career development center.  The grant funded the development of curricula and required that she published all of her work to the DPLA so that it would be reused and repurposed at other institutions across the country.  Jessica is something of a rock star in libraryland now: the curriculum for her How to Write an Effective Resume class has a 96% positive rating on the DPLA and has been adopted by 348 libraries across the country as their choice resume class.  A publisher has since approached Jessica with a deal to expand her work.
</p>
<p>
Two weeks later, Becky steps back into her local public library and waves hello to Roxanne, who is helping another library member.  Becky goes straight to the 6 public computers, signs up to use a terminal, sits down, logs in, and checks her gmail account.  Becky has become self sufficient; she doesn't need Roxanne's assistance just to check her email.  She's been working hard to learn her way around the computer and the web, and she submitted her job application to the grocery store only a few days ago.  Her inbox appears on the screen, and she nearly leaps out of her chair when she sees the message subject "Interview Request".
</p>
<p>
Another two weeks later, Becky sees Roxanne again.  This time they are in the grocery store and Roxanne is buying supplies for her weekend barbecue from Roxanne at the meat counter.

    Joanie Utter has lived in Deadwood, South Dakota all of her life.  Her name is a significant one in Deadwood, as her distant relatives Charlie and Steve Utter were some of the first settlers in the town back in the gold rush of the 1870s. Joanie loves her town and her family history, and she was always a bit frustrated by the fictional Tales from Deadwood novels by Mike Jameson as well as the HBO series.  She's had a trunk of photographs and letters in her basement for many, many years and she'd love to make them available to the public so that they can see more of the real story behind Deadwood and her family.  The local historical society has a pretty good collection of memorabilia, so Joanie decides to stop by there to see what they might be able to do for her.
